# Simple Web Application with Roda

[Roda](https://github.com/jeremyevans/roda) is a Ruby based web toolkit 'designed for building fast and maintainable web applications in ruby'.

With this example application I follow the article from [Michael R. Cook](https://mrcook.uk/static-websites-with-roda-framework).

The navigation bar is derived from Tania Rascia's article on [Responsive Dropdown Navigation Bar](https://www.taniarascia.com/responsive-dropdown-navigation-bar/).

## Development
```sh
$ bundle install
$ rerun --no-notify bundle exec rackup
```
Have fun Tweeking, Coding and testing.
